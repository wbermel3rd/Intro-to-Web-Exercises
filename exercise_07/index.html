            place for the output to go. type=text shows that text will be entered, id='name' creates IDs 
            so that each element can be referred back to, and the placeholder=text shows the text that is 
            in the input boxes before the user enters anything. the 'elements' are literally HTMLElements, 
            until they are later converted.
